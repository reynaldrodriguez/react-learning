# `03.4` Jumbotron

## :pencil: Instructions

1. Using everything you've learned, build a `Jumbotron` component that receives the following properties:

```jsx
<Jumbotron
    title="Welcome to react"
    description="React is the most popular rendering library in the world"
    buttonLabel="Go to the official website"
    buttonURL="https://reactjs.org/"
/>
```
Your HTML's component should be something like this:

```html
<div class="jumbotron m-5">
  <h1 class="display-4">Welcome to react</h1>
  <p class="lead">React is the most popular rendering library in the world</p>
  <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="https://reactjs.org/" role="button">Go to the official website</a>
</div>
```
### :bulb: Hint:

+ Remember to use prop-types to validate your component properties.

### Expected result:
